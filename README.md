## Text Summarization Project
This project implements a text summarization tool using the Hugging Face Transformers library and spaCy. The tool allows users to input lengthy text and receive concise summaries, making it easier to digest articles, papers, and other extensive content.

Features
Summarizes lengthy texts into brief summaries using state-of-the-art NLP models.
Offers both extractive and abstractive summarization methods.
Easy-to-use Python interface for text summarization.
Option for a graphical user interface using tkinter.
Requirements
Python 3.x
spacy library for natural language processing
transformers library for using pre-trained models
tkinter for GUI (optional)

## Installation

Clone the repository first thereafter follow the steps given below
A general format for cloning repository is: git clone /Link to repo/

Install the required packages:

pip install spacy transformers
Download the spaCy language model:

python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

Usage
Open the summarize.py file.

Modify the text variable with the text you want to summarize.

Run the script:

python summarize.py
Summarization Function
We provide a function that summarizes text using both extractive methods with spaCy and abstractive methods with Transformers:


def summarize_text(text, num_sentences=3):
    """Summarizes text by extracting the most important sentences.
    
    Args:
        text (str): The input text to summarize.
        num_sentences (int, optional): The desired number of sentences in the summary. Defaults to 3.
        
    Returns:
        str: The summarized text.
    """
    # Implementation of the summarization logic
Example
Here’s an example of how to summarize a text:

text = """In a world often dominated by negativity, it's important to remember the power of kindness and compassion. Small acts of kindness have the ability to brighten someone's day..."""

summary = summarize_text(text, num_sentences=3)
print(summary)
Using Hugging Face Transformers
We can also summarize text using the Hugging Face Transformers library. Here’s a sample implementation:


from transformers import pipeline

summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model='t5-base', tokenizer='t5-base')

text = """In a world often dominated by negativity, it's important to remember the power of kindness..."""

summary = summarizer(text, max_length=100, min_length=10, do_sample=False)
print(summary[0]['summary_text'])
GUI Implementation
For those interested in a graphical user interface, we have integrated a simple GUI using tkinter. This allows users to input text and receive summaries directly in the application.

python
Copy code
import tkinter as tk

def summarize_text(text):
    summary = summarizer(text, max_length=100, min_length=10, do_sample=False)
    print(summary[0]['summary_text'])
